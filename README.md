# Teen-Jobs
Teen Jobs project involving PHP/ MySQL
*********************** This Project is ongoing ******************
This project takes raw data from an excell file and puts it into a database.
xampp was used for hosting service
The "teenjobs.sql" file is used to create the database on localhost. This needs to be done first.
There are a couple of .sql files that are queries. They basically filter all the data and only display data that falls under given parameters.
The .csv files are conversions of the raw excell files. The .csv files were needed in order to input to the database.
The main project is taking that data and using it as if were a real company.
With the data from the .csv files, on localhost, it would look like a website to look up employee info.

*************** Needs work ******
the program will adventually allow the user to select the "employer" option that would allow them to add, remode, or modify employee info.

****** Please note *********
There is a user name and password associated with this project in database.php. A user will need to be created to match the ones in the file,
    or the username and password will need to be set to zero length strings.
